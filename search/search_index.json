It has been assaulted and taken by the Orcs-of-Tar-Ugruck , and then reclaimed after the Tar Ugruck were defeated by armies lead by the Paladin of Tyr named Krahan . Threats from the south, lands thought lost and inhabitable due to the time of the plague and the collapse caused by the Orcs revealed a new threat, the Vezoca-Dynasty another Human empire intent on conquering richer lands. Aggressive and driven by blind loyalty to their Emperor, its people wish to force the people of Cruidan to bow to their Dynasty, through any means possible. The-Kingdom-of-Krahan , formed in Krahan 's honour after he brought the people of Cruidan together to drive back the Tar Ugruck. Though they are still at war with the Tar Ugruck, they have spent many years rebuilding, new fortifications, the new city of Mayhearth , and many new smaller settlements. Very few buildings remain from the time before the great plague. Krahan 's Paladins-of-Tyr and Knights-of-Krahan are famous throughout the land, and yearly summer crusades are launched against the Tar Ugruck. The-League-of-Prosperity : Many of the fractured Gnome and Halfing society's, as well as many others with a mind for progress and trade, formed the League with an agreement that its Cities would remain outside of the law and government of others, and would remain neutral and peaceful, intent only on the prosperity of the land, and themselves. The Grey Order in the north of Cruidan, once a mercenary company in the fight against the Tar Ugruck. They made such a name for themselves that they were granted the lands they took back from the Orcs in the cold north of the land, and have sworn to drive the last of the Orcs out of Cruidan forever. Their services are still able to be bought, their mercenary creed running deep in their society. It is said that far to the west, across the Elven sea in the lands of Eyith , the Elves have also begun to push the Tar Ugruck back. Very little news from Eyith reaches Cruidan though, the fleets of Tar Ugruck and the Vezoca Dynasty to the south mean that ships from Krahan have to travel north, the seas of which are harsh even at the best of times, during winter only the bravest or foolish travel the Stormy Swells . Magic is considered just another element of nature within the world to be harnessed like anything else. Though people who practice it are looked on with much suspicion by the general people and experimentation with magic is punishable by law. Divine magic comes from the many gods, who have their own machinations on the world, their own power is limited within this plane, instead they prefer to grant magic to their worshippers in exchange for having their will carried out, though since the great plague the gods have been silent, no word or sign besides Divine magic still working has been heard or seen. The land has become wild, the very trees and plants becoming aggressive as they fight for fertile soil, different species popping up and dying. The surviving beasts and other creatures of the land, the strong or those that have adapted, have made large areas dangerous. Even within the borders of the kingdoms there have been reports of strange beasts and animal attacks. Some laws of Krahan 1. Murder is punishable by Death by hanging. 2. Thievery is punishable by imprisonment, forced service or confiscation of all property and possessions. 3. Spreading sickness is punishable by Death by Pyre. 4. Experimentation with arcane or divine magic is punishable by Death by hanging. 5. Failure to defend the kingdom or its people is punishable by forced service. extended laws The Law of self defence states that if you can prove you were defending yourself after killing someone, that you are innocent.

It has been assaulted and taken by the Orcs-of-Tar-Ugruck , and then reclaimed after the Tar Ugruck were defeated by armies lead by the Paladin of Tyr named Krahan . Threats from the south, lands thought lost and inhabitable due to the time of the plague and the collapse caused by the Orcs revealed a new threat, the Vezoca-Dynasty another Human empire intent on conquering richer lands. Aggressive and driven by blind loyalty to their Emperor, its people wish to force the people of Cruidan to bow to their Dynasty, through any means possible. The-Kingdom-of-Krahan , formed in Krahan 's honour after he brought the people of Cruidan together to drive back the Tar Ugruck. Though they are still at war with the Tar Ugruck, they have spent many years rebuilding, new fortifications, the new city of Mayhearth , and many new smaller settlements. Very few buildings remain from the time before the great plague. Krahan 's Paladins-of-Tyr and Knights-of-Krahan are famous throughout the land, and yearly summer crusades are launched against the Tar Ugruck. The-League-of-Prosperity : Many of the fractured Gnome and Halfing society's, as well as many others with a mind for progress and trade, formed the League with an agreement that its Cities would remain outside of the law and government of others, and would remain neutral and peaceful, intent only on the prosperity of the land, and themselves. The Grey Order in the north of Cruidan, once a mercenary company in the fight against the Tar Ugruck. They made such a name for themselves that they were granted the lands they took back from the Orcs in the cold north of the land, and have sworn to drive the last of the Orcs out of Cruidan forever. Their services are still able to be bought, their mercenary creed running deep in their society. It is said that far to the west, across the Elven sea in the lands of Eyith , the Elves have also begun to push the Tar Ugruck back. Very little news from Eyith reaches Cruidan though, the fleets of Tar Ugruck and the Vezoca Dynasty to the south mean that ships from Krahan have to travel north, the seas of which are harsh even at the best of times, during winter only the bravest or foolish travel the Stormy Swells . Magic is considered just another element of nature within the world to be harnessed like anything else. Though people who practice it are looked on with much suspicion by the general people and experimentation with magic is punishable by law. Divine magic comes from the many gods, who have their own machinations on the world, their own power is limited within this plane, instead they prefer to grant magic to their worshippers in exchange for having their will carried out, though since the great plague the gods have been silent, no word or sign besides Divine magic still working has been heard or seen. The land has become wild, the very trees and plants becoming aggressive as they fight for fertile soil, different species popping up and dying. The surviving beasts and other creatures of the land, the strong or those that have adapted, have made large areas dangerous. Even within the borders of the kingdoms there have been reports of strange beasts and animal attacks. Some laws of Krahan 1. Murder is punishable by Death by hanging. 2. Thievery is punishable by imprisonment, forced service or confiscation of all property and possessions. 3. Spreading sickness is punishable by Death by Pyre. 4. Experimentation with arcane or divine magic is punishable by Death by hanging. 5. Failure to defend the kingdom or its people is punishable by forced service. extended laws The Law of self defence states that if you can prove you were defending yourself after killing someone, that you are innocent. There are many minor laws to do with hygiene and sickness, latrines for example must be properly situated. Forced service is 1 to 5 years conscription.

Later writers, during AD&D 2e, would correct this nomenclature, since the English suffix -ite normally denotes a mineral, and the metal was renamed to adamantine. Drow of the Underdark (1991) retconned that \"adamantite\" was a mineral from which the metal alloy adamantine could be made (credit to illustro's answer for this, which deserves upvotes). Pure adamantite worked into a metal is called \"adamantium\", which Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (1996), p.55, carefully renames to \"adamant\", defining adamatine as a durable alloy of adamant, silver and electrum. However, this is subsequently contradicted by the D&D 3.5 Dungeon Master's Guide (2000), p. 283, where adamantine is simply a unique meteoric metal. Magic of Faer\u00fbn (2001) concurred with this and wrote off the \"alloy of silver and electrum\" theory described in Volo's Guide as a fanciful myth. The connection between \"adamantite\" and the drow is that this was the nomenclature used by Gygax when he wrote D3 Vault of the Drow (1978). Even in the specific context of the drow, we see this corrected to \"adamantine\" in later books (e.g. Drow of the Underdark (2007) p.199). From 3e onward, the older term \"adamantite\" was almost never used. Adamantite \u00b6 \"Adamantite\" appears briefly in the AD&D 1e Player's Handbook (1978), and again in the Dungeon Masters Guide (1979), where it is a material certain items are made from: Daern's Instant Fortress (p. 152) has \"adamantite walls\", The Saw of Mighty Cutting (p. 153) is an \"adamantite blade\", and the Talisman of the Sphere (p. 155) is an \"adamantite loop\". +5 armor is adamantite alloyed steel (p. 154). An \"adamantite door\" appears in Gygax's S1 Tomb of Horrors . Even after Gygax's departure fron TSR, the use of \"adamantite\" continued into many products of AD&D 2e, such as the Planescape Planes of Conflict (1995), where adamantite dragons are said to inhabit Bytopia (Liber Benevolentiae, p.43). Adamantine \u00b6 Some AD&D 2e books referred to \"adamantine\". After Drow of the Underdark (1991), Book of Artifacts (1993) refers to the metal \"adamantine\" (credit to illustro for this reference). This is not used entirely consistently throughout AD&D. The AD&D 2e revised Dungeon Master Guide (1996) still used \"adamantite\" throughout. However, the use of \"adamantine\" to refer to the metal was standardized with D&D 3e (2000), where it appeared in the Dungeon Master's Guide , and has remained so ever since. References to \"adamantite\", \"adamantium\" and \"adamant\" have been discontinued. D&D 3e routinely converts specific instances of \"adamantite\" to adamantine. Daern's Instant Fortress is now made of adamantine. Bytopia is now inhabited by adamantine dragons (Dragon #321, p.44). The 3e Tomb of Horrors web conversion even describes the 1e-era doors as having been made of adamantine (p.25): The 1-foot-thick steel door (it's too expensive for the demons to keep replacing adamantine doors) is suffused with a globe of invulnerability effect. Drow connection to \"adamantite\" \u00b6 D3 Vault of the Drow described the drow working an alloy of \"adamantite\" and steel, which they draw into a wire used to make a fine mesh for armor. (p. 13): These creatures dwell in a pool of molten lava at the far end of their smithy, and they make the adamantite alloy and draw the wire. And: Drow wear a fine mesh armor of exquisite workmanship. It is an alloy of steel containing adamantite [...] The value of this alloy is that when it is exposed to the strange radiation in the Drow homeland (see MODULE D3, VAULT OF THE DROW) for a period of one month, its magical bonuses come to the fore. I cannot find any reference to adamantite working differently with poison, except that both drow adamantite armor and drow poison lose their efficacy when taken from the Underdark to the sunlit surface. In fact, the drow specifically have to re-apply their poison over time: Drow sleep poison decays instantly in sunlight. Its power is lost after about 60 days in any event, and the coating on the small bolts and javelins must be periodically renewed with fresh applications of the fungoid substance. The Dark Elves will often have small barrels filled with several packets of this poison, each sealed to insure the poisonous substance remains fresh for about 1 year. Summary \u00b6 AD&D 1e : Adamantine is a metal which is virtually indestructable. It can be made into armor or items. The drow alloy it with steel. AD&D 2e : Technically, adamantite is the ore from which the metal adamant (also called adamantium) is made. This metal is alloyed with silver and electrum to make the alloy adamantine. However, the term \"adamantite\" is still widely used to refer to the metal itself. D&D 3e onward : Adamantine is a rare meteoric metal. It's not made by alloying with silver and electrum; that's just a myth. All previous references referring to the metal as \"adamantite\" are updated to the new nomenclature.

Later writers, during AD&D 2e, would correct this nomenclature, since the English suffix -ite normally denotes a mineral, and the metal was renamed to adamantine. Drow of the Underdark (1991) retconned that \"adamantite\" was a mineral from which the metal alloy adamantine could be made (credit to illustro's answer for this, which deserves upvotes). Pure adamantite worked into a metal is called \"adamantium\", which Volo's Guide to All Things Magical (1996), p.55, carefully renames to \"adamant\", defining adamatine as a durable alloy of adamant, silver and electrum. However, this is subsequently contradicted by the D&D 3.5 Dungeon Master's Guide (2000), p. 283, where adamantine is simply a unique meteoric metal. Magic of Faer\u00fbn (2001) concurred with this and wrote off the \"alloy of silver and electrum\" theory described in Volo's Guide as a fanciful myth. The connection between \"adamantite\" and the drow is that this was the nomenclature used by Gygax when he wrote D3 Vault of the Drow (1978). Even in the specific context of the drow, we see this corrected to \"adamantine\" in later books (e.g. Drow of the Underdark (2007) p.199). From 3e onward, the older term \"adamantite\" was almost never used.","title":"Adamantine metal was known as \"adamantite\" in earlier D&amp;D products."},{"location":"Notes/Adamantite%20or%20Adamantine/#adamantite","text":"\"Adamantite\" appears briefly in the AD&D 1e Player's Handbook (1978), and again in the Dungeon Masters Guide (1979), where it is a material certain items are made from: Daern's Instant Fortress (p. 152) has \"adamantite walls\", The Saw of Mighty Cutting (p. 153) is an \"adamantite blade\", and the Talisman of the Sphere (p. 155) is an \"adamantite loop\". +5 armor is adamantite alloyed steel (p. 154).

Even after Gygax's departure fron TSR, the use of \"adamantite\" continued into many products of AD&D 2e, such as the Planescape Planes of Conflict (1995), where adamantite dragons are said to inhabit Bytopia (Liber Benevolentiae, p.43).","title":"Adamantite"},{"location":"Notes/Adamantite%20or%20Adamantine/#adamantine","text":"Some AD&D 2e books referred to \"adamantine\".

Upon arriving at Winterfield we headed to the Temple to see Halword , he was expecting us and told us Lady Aliyah wanted to know when we arrived. Lady Aliyah tested the trustworthiness of the party, apart from Shed (who has the trust of her god, Tyr ), and we talked about the shared dream we have been having as a group, the Arcane Forge , Halwords prophecy, and Halwords and Lady Aliyah's dreams. We headed to the tavern afterwards to rest for the night and to consider our next move. Log \u00b6 D18: Day 6 of travel, after combat with the orcs , the shared dream \u00b6 We just fought the orcs and agreed to travel with the knights at the behest of the Royal Messenger. We set up our camp close to the knights camp The knights seem as amateurish in setting up their camp as they do at battle. Watch: Oz 20 - Eachann 23 - Shed 22 - Markus 16 Jurgen tells the sergeant about the gnolls that we fought previously. The Knight camp is split into 2 groups The Knight Commander & co, rowdier and telling tales of battle despite not really being involved in the fight. The Knight Sergeant Tren Havenhorn & co., quieter, more serious, some remorseful after they have lost comrades against the orc scouting party We eat at the knights camp Royal Messenger is flitting about both groups and comes to speak to us Royal Messenger - Sir Fared Dalan \u00b6 Claims he \"technically\" has the rank of Lord, no land but wealthy Claims he can find his way anywhere Carries his messages in a satchel Has a message for Lady Aliyah and a message for the mayor of Winterfield from Prince Jasper The messages are magically sealed (scrolls with metal wire wrapped around them) They require an enchanted ring from the King to open. serves various houses not just House Brannigan Picked up the knights with him from Fort Whitall Eachann decides to try writing a ballad about him Sir Ferro 's loot ^9467f3 \u00b6 The dagger is a fine dagger The sword seems magical (is also flavourless) The party move back to their own camp and talk about the coded letter picked up from Rhetts house, talking about his debt to something called the grin . No-one in the party has heard of them. Need to ask Halword how he found out how Rhett had the map Rhett was in Winterfield bragging We all have the dream for the first time. \u00b6 ^8b09fa We rest for the night and during Shed's watch she falls asleep for what seems like just a moment and all of the party experience a shared dream , like the one Ozmir has been having. (I have excluded my handwritten notes in favour of the write up from DM). Need to ask Ozmir if his dream was the same all of the time and he omitted information when he told us about it Some aspects of shimmering orc banner images remind me of a long forgotten memory but I can't quite grasp it. Party checks about the livery of the knights Flaming sword knight - God of Tempest Bound hands knights - Knights of Ilmitar , the broken god, the ones who endures Horse/chess piece knights - Knights of the Red Oz asks Shed about Selune's sister Shar , the goddess of night We go back to sleep, with no more dreams. D19: Day 7 of travel \u00b6 Eachann plays us some ballads, day passes without incident Camp for the night -1 ration D20: Day 8 of travel, the tale of Lod, who was lost \u00b6 Skorris plays us a little of the Dwarven song, Lod's Lost The ballad of a dwarf lost in the tunnels, who carved a flute from the support beams so he could guide his brethren to him. Camp -1 ration We all have the shared dream again, same time of night during Shed's watch. D21: Day 9 of travel \u00b6 Bad breakfast A pile of charred corpses on the side of the road - orcs, looks like they've been here a while Getting out of the mountains, still a little frosty but it's starting to lift, starting to see travellers on the roads Camp, hunt, couple of rabbits We all have the dream again Oz is very upset by part of the dream, watching the ship going down every night. Oz started having the dream once we set off from Winterfield Why? Oz was forced to leave his ship & crew Eachann says he is from a simple farming village near the mountains and that he has never been in a set of armour. Eachann & Markus note that as the two humans of the group, they \"share\" a particular part of the dream. Skorris has heard secrets of things in the mountain Mor Badir , it was lost to the trolls many years ago. ^fdf6d4 Mor Badir is 1 week west of Winterfield Markus has been deciphering the notebook that we got with the map (forgot to add this to previous session notes) D22: Day 10 of travel, we arrive in Winterfield late into the night \u00b6 We see some Knights of Tyr talking to the Keepers at their tower Overhear Knight Sergeant Tren saying Lady Aliyah is still in Winterfield, has set up a HQ Couple of Keepers ask our business in town (standard practice) Dave the Keeper We head to the Temple of Selune. \u00b6 Halword goes a little pale upon seeing us There have been developments since we left Lady Aliyah is in Winterfield and has asked Halword to let her know as soon as we get back to town. Oz mentions the dream \"Odd occurence\" - Halword Halword has an assistant, a tiefling named Marphi He asks her to fetch Lady Aliyah She arrived in Winterfield a few days after we left, she has also experienced a dream. Asked Halword about how he knew Rhett had the map Rhett was in town bragging about the map over winter, he somehow managed to make it back to Copperhead despite the harsh winter weather.

In the process, they formed the goddess Chauntea, whom they worked with to bless the worlds with life.' 'This universe was darkened by the hair and welcoming embrace of Shar and illuminated by the cool radiant face of Sel\u00fbne. However, there was no fire or heat on any of these bodies. Desiring to nurture life on the worlds that formed her body and limbs, Chauntea asked the Two-Faced Goddess for warmth. Then, for the first time, Shar and Sel\u00fbne were divided, being of two minds on whether they should let there be more life on the worlds or not' 'The two goddesses then fought over the fate of their creations. From the residues of these struggles emerged the original deities of magic, war, disease, murder, death, and others. Seizing an advantage, Sel\u00fbne reached out of the universe altogether and into a plane of fire and, though it burned her painfully, brought forth a fragment of ever-living flame.

We heading back to the temple to get some more information from Lady-Aliyah & Halward , did some shopping for supplies and sold up our goods. Then stopping off to meet with the captured orc for a brief conversation, we left Winterfield and headed to Tyr's Hollow. At Tyr's Hollow we met up with the dwarf Hamdec Coalguard who agreed to aid in guiding us through the underground passes around Mor Badir . We set out from Tyr's Hollow and headed south, into the mountain pass north of the burning lake, intending to follow the Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge and see what we uncover. Log \u00b6 Note: The assassins had tattoos of The Crimson Grin . At the Winterfield Tavern \u00b6 We slept at the inn with no dreams, no visions Looking around at breakfast we note a bard in the tavern (with a lute), also a gnome . Skorris mentions Tyr's Hollow - There is a dwarf there he should speak to, knows his way underground, to Mor Badir - Hamdec Coalguard from Khaz Gurum, left the dwarf empire years ago We plan to head and see the dwarf before heading to The Burning Lake , following the Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge Shopping with the gnomish travelling merchant \u00b6 [GnomeIThe gnome from the tavern] is a travelling merchant with some magical goods for sale. - Oz bought Fire Wine - Eachann got a cloak of dramatic Entrance - Dwarven Moss moment - (note Eachann's instrument is called a yarting) - He also sold a bag that you pull animals from? The great ink haggling (Eachann and Markus) Meeting at the Temple \u00b6 We head to the temple to meet Lady Aliyah and Halward . LA asked Kari about the assassins, Kari was worried they were after her. Note: One of the assassins escaped from the party's pursuit. The message LA received from Prince Jasper requested her aid, Orcs are invading Krahan but the army of krahan is protecting the interior.
