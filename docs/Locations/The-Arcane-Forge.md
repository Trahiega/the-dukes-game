# The Arcane Forge
![[Map Arcane Forge.png]]
The Arcane Forge is located on the north east side of the Burning Lake, southeast of Tyr's Hollow.

It is in a long abandoned dwarven hold, currently inhabited by goblins.

Markus holds the artefact that allows entrance into the forge, and has used it to forge a set of armour with the adamantine found in the area.

The Arcane Forge is believed to be in the mountains underground, and may contain the [[Moonlit Crown]]

Arcane Forge may be the human name for a dwarven thing.

[[Halword-Priest-of-Selune|Halword]] tasked [[The Party|the party]] with retrieving the map and returning it to him. He believes it to be in the hands of [[Quick-Rhett|Quick Rhett]], in Copperhead, who is forming a group to seek out the treasure.

We retrieved the map from Quick Rhett's house and returned it to Halword, whilst we were travelling Markus made a copy.

There are annotations on the map in Dwarvish.

We found a notebook with the map, Markus has been working on translating it.
