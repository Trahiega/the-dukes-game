# Moonlit Crown
![[Moonlit Crown.jpg|200]]
"When it is restored to it's rightful place, Sel没ne's glory will be restored to the world"

"The champion with the crown can destroy the orc threat."" - Halword

## The Prophecy of the Champion of Sel没ne
The Prophecy: After the chaos brought by the plague, Sel没ne's champion must find the lost crown, in the light of the moon, at the resting place of the previous champion. The new will be blessed and so shall Sel没ne's followers, the threat shall be expelled from the land.

The original Prophecy text was lost sometime during the Great Plague, 

Halword's research comes from word of mouth, journal entries and translations of the text from other languages.

Halword believes the original text was in Elvish, and that there are many variations on what the actual words could be.

The grave of the last Champion of the Moon lies on the mountain above Hor Faldur, a Dwarven hold to the west of Krahans borders.

He knows little about what a champions purpose is, or why they are blessed. But he has faith in Selune that she knows what she is doing.
