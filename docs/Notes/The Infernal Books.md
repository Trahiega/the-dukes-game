# The Infernal Books
## The First Book
We found a magically locked chest at the camp of gnolls that seem to have attacked the troupe of House Galawin on the road. Inside we found a book written in infernal and some gemstones, that seem to be connected to the book.

We showed the book to [[Halward-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]] and [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] when we returned to Winterfield.

- It is not of this plane
- It is written in infernal and relates to devil summoning
- There is a presence of evil about the book
- Ozmir & Marphi read infernal and spent some time with the book
- We left it with Halward at the temple, along with the gemstones

## The Second Book
In the dwarven hold housing the Arcane Forge, in the room adjacent to the one holding the Moonlit Crown, we found a second infernal book.

The morning after returning to Tyr's Hollow, Markus took out the book from his bag of holding to inspect it.  
Eachann wonders if it is connected the dreams.  

- The book is identical to the first book
- It made Saniel feel very uneasy in it's presence.
- It is also written in infernal and related to devil summoning
