# The Infernal Books
Books that radiate evil, the writing in the Infernal language of devils.
When [[Shar]] spoke to us she said the books were used by [[the Duke]] to watch and corrupt. Responsible for the corruption of [[Marphi]], we know we must destroy any of these books we find.

It remains an open question as to why the first book was in the hands of [[Sir-Ferro-of-House-Galawin|Sir Ferro]], did he know of it's purpose? Where was he taking it?

## The First Book
We found a magically locked chest at the camp of gnolls that seem to have attacked the troupe of House Galawin on the road. Inside we found a book written in infernal and some gemstones, that seem to be connected to the book.

We showed the book to [[Halword-Priest-of-Selune|Halward]], [[Marphi]] and [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] when we returned to Winterfield.

- It is not of this plane
- It is written in infernal and relates to devil summoning
- There is a presence of evil about the book
- Ozmir & Marphi read infernal and spent some time with the book
- We left it with Halward at the temple, along with the gemstones

After the Duke's reveal, we believe that the book was responsible for [[Marphi]]'s corruption so we returned to Winterfield to destroy it After many attempts, the radiant damage of a Sacred Flame caused the books to crumble into ash.

## The Gemstones
The gems found with the first book were soul stones, made to hold the souls of humanoid sacrifices to be used in the summoning of a devil.
We destroyed the gems when we returned to Winterfield to destroy the first book.

## The Second Book
In the dwarven hold housing the Arcane Forge, in the room adjacent to the one holding the Moonlit Crown, we found a second infernal book.

The morning after returning to Tyr's Hollow, Markus took out the book from his bag of holding to inspect it.  
Eachann wonders if it is connected the dreams.  

- The book is identical to the first book
- It made Saniel feel very uneasy in it's presence.
- It is also written in infernal and related to devil summoning

We showed the second book again to [[Halword-Priest-of-Selune|Halword]] and [[Marphi]] at the Temple north of Tyr's Hollow, confirming that it was identical to the first book we found, and deciding to leave it with them. Later that day, when the Duke revealed himself and Marphi joined him, we believe she took the book with her.
