##### Back to Winterfield
We decide for now to head back to Winterfield to try and locate the first infernal book.
- There are many troops on the road, in high spirits
- Many people are working towards the war effort
- At the gate the guards are wary
	- Quite suspicious of Shedatha
	- Shed is warned to watch herself around town
- We go straight to the Temple
	- Informed the priest of Halword's death & Marphi's corruption
- He gives us access to the first infernal book and the gemstones that we left there.
	- The gems are soul stones, they will hold the souls of sacrificed humanoids to be used in the summoning of a devil.
		- What had Lord Ferro doing with these?
		- Were House Galawin planning to summon more devils?
	- Most magical items can be destroyed by normal means
- We attempt to destroy the book
	- Untouched by fire
	- The Duke's face appears and laughs at us through the book
	- Skorris' Axe does not damage it
	- Dispel magic nothing
	- Moonlit spear nothing
	- Can't tear the pages
	- Eachann writes "Fuck off you prick" in the book, but it fades away
	- Markus & Saniel both use Sacred Flame
		- The book starts to curl & crisp
	- Again, with Shed's radiant bolts this time
- After several attacks on the book it slowly crumbles into ash.
	- Saniel stops feeling the sickness caused by the presence of the book
	- Saniel also destroys the soul stones with sacred flame
- Shed asks the priest to discreetly spread the word about evil in the land, and evil books and how they can be destroyed.
- Jurgen is speaking in tongues in the temple

- Should we go to Mayhearth next or use the teleporter?

LEVEL UP!
Will take another level in Barbarian.

## Loose Ends
