# Eyith

It is said that far to the west, across the Elven sea in the lands of [[Eyith]], the Elves have also begun to push the Tar Ugruck back. Very little news from Eyith reaches Cruidan though, the fleets of Tar Ugruck and the Vezoca Dynasty to the south mean that ships from [[Krahan]] have to travel north, the seas of which are harsh even at the best of times, during winter only the bravest or foolish travel the [[Stormy Swells]].
