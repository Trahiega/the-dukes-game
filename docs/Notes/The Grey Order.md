# The Grey Order
In the north of Cruidan, once a mercenary company in the fight against the Tar Ugruck. They made such a name for themselves that they were granted the lands they took back from the Orcs in the cold north of the land, and have sworn to drive the last of the Orcs out of Cruidan forever. Their services are still able to be bought, their mercenary creed running deep in their society.
