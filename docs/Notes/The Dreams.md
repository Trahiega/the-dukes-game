# The Dreams
The party has been experiencing a shared dream, it was the same each time until we recovered the Moonlit Crown.

### Perspective in the dream
In the centre of a crater, having fallen down to Cruidan, we feel great power and looking down we see are dressed in fine purple clothes, lined with shimmering silver. We command the shadows cast by the moonlight, and attempt to pull the artefacts into our grasp. Each artefact holds the attention of different members of our group.  

Ozmir's vision remains fixed on the band, if he fails to grasp it everything he knows will fall. He sees a captain going down with her ship.

A voice says  'It is too late, he knows.. he watches..I cannot...fight him... find.... my... sister'

The voice begins to fade 'too late... '
