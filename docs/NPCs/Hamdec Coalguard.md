# Hamdec Coalguard
Originally from Khaz Gurum, Hamdec now has a house in the north of [[Tyr's Hollow]].  
We first met him there when we were looking for a guide into the mountains to follow the map to the Arcane Forge and perhaps venture into Mor Badir. He joined with us for several days when we ventured into the mountains near the burning lake and found the ancient dwarven hold that houses the Arcane Forge. On guard outside with Jurgen, tending to our horses, Hamdec & Jurgen were attacked by trolls and fled our camp. Fortunately we met them on the road after leaving the Arcane Forge and we travelled back to Tyr's Hollow with them. Hamdec was paid for his services, and said  he might travel with us again but the price would go up after last time. 

#### Last Seen
We last talked to Hamdec in the Tyr's Hollow tavern in [[Session-018|Session 18]]
