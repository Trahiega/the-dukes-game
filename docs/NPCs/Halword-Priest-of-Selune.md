# Halword, Priest of Selûne
Halword was a priest who tended the [[Winterfield#Temple of Selune|Temple of Selûne]] in [[Winterfield]], with his assistant [[Marphi]].

He sent us on a quest to retrieve the [[Map-to-the-Arcane-Forge|map to the Arcane Forge]] from Quick Rhett in Copperhead, in hopes that it would lead to the [[Moonlit Crown]], an artefact of great value to the temple that was lost at the Forge. Halword warned us to beware of the [[Thieves-Guild|Thieves' Guild]], and to beware travelling to [[Mayhearth]].

> "When the crown is restored to it's rightful place, Selûne's glory will be restored to the world"

After retrieving the map from Copperhead, and with the strange dream fresh in their minds, the party met Halword again at the Winterfield temple. Halword had also had a strange dream, and had been assembling information about the crown into a prophecy. He believed that Shedatha may be the Champion of the Moon, and that the champion with the crown can destroy the orc threat. Before we left Winterfield once more, Halword gifted Shedatha the [[Gloves of the two faced goddess]].
