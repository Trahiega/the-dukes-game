# Mulrah the Seeker
Mulrah was part of the [[Orc-scouting-party]], until he was captured by [[Lady-Aliyah|Lady Aliyah]] and kept as a prisoner. His captors attempted to glean some information from him about the Orc army, but he would not tell them anything.

In Winterfield, Shedatha talked with Mulrah. He had a deep distrust of her, especially as she associated with humans.
He told Shedatha that he is a diplomat of sorts, his mission to find allies for the orc army in the mountains, (perhaps the half orcs?). He said the humans were granted the land of Krahan by the Elves & Dwarves, who the orcs were once slaves to until Tar Ugruck broke them away from elvish tyranny. The orcs used to worship Selune a long time ago, but now they worship mother nature.

#### Last Seen

His orcish has a different accent to Shedatha's, more flowery, Shed's is more guttaral.
