## Session Summary



## Log
- Markus is investigating the forge
- The Runes around the forge can be infused with magic
	- Nature magic, Elementals, magic users
- All of the instructions are in Dwarvish
- Some of the writings are nor easily readable to Markus, they are ancient and the language is different.
- References to magic items (Dwarvish)
	- including the cube that Markus has
	- Also references to Dwarven gods
- Adamantite is the strongest metal the dwarves know
- We have access to adamantite ingots in the mines
- The forge can enchant an already crafted item, or you can enchant it during the crafting of a new item
	- The second option results in the stronger enchantment
- There are leylines on the ground
	- Seen as literal lines the dwarves have carved into the floor
- The AF is half the crafting time of a regular forge
- There are tools around the room marked with runes, these items cannot be taken out of the forge

- Skorris & Oz head outside to check on our camp, it has been about 2 days since we left Hamdec outside with Jurgen.
	- Neither are at the camp, there is one dead horse and the rest of the horses, the mule and the cart are gone
	- Trolls?

- Shed spent 1 hour with the crown and whilst we know it is a powerful magical artifact, we know nothing more yet

- Eachann fetches some ingots for Markus
- Shed attunes to the spear
- The goblins are celebrating the death of the dead things and exploring the caves

- Skorris & Oz return
	- The camp outside has been destroyed
	- Shed wants to follow the tracks and check if our guide yet lives, but Markus refuses to leave the forge
	- Oz & Skorris want to explore the caves
	- Shed is still on low HP from the necrotic damage so can't leave on her own.

- We leave Markus in the forge to craft and the rest of us explore the cave
- Goblin fishing lake
	- There is another blue gem in the water
	- Oz & Eachann swim in and Eachann retrieves the gem
- We check in on Markus and Skorris, then Skorris heads out with us to the spider side of the caves

- There is a big spider queen, the goblins would like us to kill the big one, but not the little ones, they're good for food
- We decide against it
- Instead we venture into the west area where it looked like something had burrowed
	- BIG SPIDER!
	- grabbed Skorris
	- Skorris feeds a chunk of spider to the Maw and gains spider climb
	-
