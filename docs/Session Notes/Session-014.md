## Session Summary

## Log
After the battle with the Bone Construct

We fought the guardian of the crown.

In the next room we found a corpse holding books  
	1. A book similar to the first [[The Infernal Books|infernal book]]   
	2. A damaged spell book fillled with mad writings/insane ramblings  
		 - The last words of Mirethell the Wizard
