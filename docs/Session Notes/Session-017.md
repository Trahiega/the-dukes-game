# Session 17, The Duke's Grand Entrance
Date of session: 2022-09-14

## Session Summary
We entered the Temple of Sel√ªne and caught up with Halward & Marphi, Marphi has a spell to help identify the champion before we head to the last champion's grave to empower the Moonlit Crown.

Later that day, when the moon had risen, we joined Halward & Marphi at the temple to enact the ritual. As Shed handed over the Moonlit Crown a shadowy figure appeared and took it form her.

The Duke, he calls himself, told us many things, though how much is true is hard to say. Shar revealed herself to us, she has been trapped by him. Marphi has been corrupted by the Duke and she takes Halwards life, we fight against her transformed form of Shadow that the Duke had brought forth.

When the battle seems near it's end the Duke intervenes, holding us all in place as he did when he took the crown. He offers Ozmir a deal, a theft for the life of his friend & her ship.
Duke, Marphi & Ozmir leave through the Duke's portal.
