# Session 16 - Trolls on the road, Back to Tyr's Hollow
Date of session: 2022-08-31  
In-game day count: Day   

## Session Summary

## Log
- A new player joins the party!
- The goblins last saw the gnome merchant about a year ago, so he is probably due soon.
- We leave the cave and head back to our ruined camp to scout for our horses and missing companions.
	- Spark was the horse that died (Markus' horse)
- We found Oddball
- Skorris smells Troll, we hear a roar through the mountains
- We also hear shouting on the wind, though the intent behind the shouts we can't discern
- Heading towards the sound we come across Jurgen and Hamdec injured, cowering by a mountain side facing a Troll.
- Combat! 2 [[Trolls]]
	- 15 to hit
	- Saniel appears
		- Can heal, also can summon spiritual weapon
	- Trolls have to be burned to make it die (Acid also works)
	- Skorris feeds some troll to the Maw gaining temp +1 AC
		- then he feeds it again and grows to be a troll-sized dwarf
- Skorris shouts out "I got big!" just as he shrinks back to his normal size
- Ozmir makes an offhand comment about technically having a crown?
- Saniel is exceptionally beautiful, she has golden yellow hair and golden eyes. We hear the gentle clink of armour as she moves, she is not an elf. She is 40 years old.
	- She is a Cleric of Eldath, goddess of life, water, nature, peace
	- Brought here by a dream
		- A vivid dream, a prophecy of doom worse than the great plague
		- A silver crown
		- A tiefling wrapped in shadow, unable to see what they look like
	- Communication with the gods
		- They no longer talk back
			- Which gods?

- We take a short rest then decide to forgo finding the other horses and head back to Tyr's Hollow.
- We push on to try and make the town this night.
- Tyr's Hollow is not as big as Winterfield
- We get into town late, head to the inn, eat & rest
	- 6 gold for the food and rooms
	- Markus pays Hamdec 50g and he heads back to his home
- Long rest
	- The dream comes to us
	- Mostly the same there are some changes
	- The crown now settles into our grasp and we hold it firmly
	- Ozmir feels the power coursing through the crown in his grasp, and then it disappears from his hands
- Shed goes into Oz's room to talk about the dream
	- She's upset/frustrated
	- Oz assures her we're on the right path, the ship is not going to sink
	- He suggest she should try wearing the crown
	- Reluctantly Shed sits on the floor of Oz's room and puts on the crown, remaining there for the rest of the night meditating.
		- No visions, no guidance, nothing
- Markus asks DM if he can glean anything about the artefacts in the dream, but they are nothing he has heard of or seen before.
- Eachann also comes into Ozmir's room
- He wonders if the bad book is connected.
	- The dreams did start about the time we found the book, they also seemed to stop when we left the book in Winterfield.
	- We found another ominous book in the Arcane Forge, though also Saniel joined us.
- misc note: Ozmir's tail is 5ft long

- The next morning, breakfast at the inn
	- Discussing Eachann's theory about the book
	- Markus pulls out the book we found at the AF, it is identical to the first book we found.
	- The book makes Saniel feel very uneasy.
	- When Markus puts the book back into the bag of holding she feels better.
	- Ozmir is the first tiefling that Saniel has seen.
- We need to get more horses

- We head to the Temple
- Inside we see some familiar figures, Halward and Marphi
- Halward did not expect to see us so soon, Marphi has discovered more of the prophecy.

## Loose Ends
- [ ] Ozmir technically has a crown?
- [ ] Which gods no longer talk back to Saniel's knowledge?
- [ ] Are the bad books connected to the dream?
- [ ] Did Markus take any writings from the forge?
- [ ] What of the writings taken from the room where we found the crown?
- [ ] What of Ozmir's new part of the dream?
	- [ ] Should Ozmir have the crown or are we meant to keep it from him?
	- [ ] He said the ship will not sink now?
